# what's happening

##### Problem Statement:

Do you know how many votes went down in Congress today? Me neither.
So I googled it. On this particular day, there were <b>94</b>.

So, who chooses which of these 94 issues are important? The news.

The problem is the news and you may have different ideas of
what is important. And sometimes, let's face it, there is just
so much news(and frankly other political distractions always going on),
that we miss the actual gears that make the country run.

The goal of this project is to have a manageable way for
constituents to search for relevant issues, keep tabs on
their congresspeople, get voter information, and hopefully
inspire the desire to hold our politicians accountable.
